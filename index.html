  <!-- About Section -->
  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      From analyzing large datasets to deploying AI-powered applications, my journey has been about making data work smarter and more impactful. 
      I’m passionate about <strong>Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong>, <strong>Data Analytics</strong>, and <strong>AI solutions</strong> 
      that go beyond numbers—tools that help people ask better questions, uncover deeper insights, and drive informed decision-making.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve developed projects such as a <strong>NYC Property Price Predictor</strong> using PySpark, XGBoost, and SHAP, and a 
      <strong>Streamlit app for LLMs in Business Intelligence</strong> powered by Hugging Face transformers, gaining hands-on experience with 
      predictive modeling, natural language query generation, and interactive analytics. Along the way, I’ve worked with models and algorithms 
      including <strong>Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Trees</strong> to solve business and analytical challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m continuing to expand my expertise in <strong>LLMs, NLP, and AI model deployment</strong>, while exploring emerging areas such as 
      <strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), embeddings, and multimodal AI</strong>. My focus is on bridging advanced AI techniques 
      with real-world applications to create solutions that are both powerful and practical.
